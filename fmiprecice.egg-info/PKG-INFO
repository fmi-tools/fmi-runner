Description: # preCICE-FMI Runner
        
        A Runner tool to enable co-simulations with FMU models via the coupling library [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/precice).
        
        ## Installation 
        
        ### Required dependencies
        
        Ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
        
        * Python 3 or higher
        * [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki)
        * [pyprecice: Python language bindings for preCICE](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings)
        * [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
        * [fmpy](https://fmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/)
        
        ### Build and install the Runner using pip
        
        After cloning this repository, go to the project directory `fmi-runner` and run `pip3 install --user .`. 
        If you want to be able to update the Runner by simply pulling this repository, run `pip3 install --user -e .`.
        
        ### Build and install the Runner using Python
        
        After cloning this repository, go to the project directory `fmi-runner` and run `python setup.py install --user`.
        
        ## Running a simulation
        
        The Runner is called from the terminal with the command `fmiprecice`. It takes two input files, one with settings for the FMU simulation and one with settings for preCICE. Start the runner by calling
        
        ```bash
        fmiprecice ./fmi-settings.json ./precice-settings.json
        ```
        
        Have a look at the preCICE [Oscillator tutorial](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/tree/master/oscillator) for a first complete setup with FMU model and setting files.
